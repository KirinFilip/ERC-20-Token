## What is ERC20?

ERC-20 is the technical standard for fungible tokens created using the Ethereum blockchain. A fungible token is one that is interchangeable with another token, in other words, they have a property that makes each Token be exactly the same (in type and value) as another Token. For example, an ERC-20 Token acts just like the ETH, meaning that 1 Token is and will always be equal to all the other Tokens. This makes ERC20 tokens useful for things like a medium of exchange currency, voting rights, staking, and more.

### Tokens can represent virtually anything in Ethereum:
* reputation points in an online platform
* skills of a character in a game
* lottery tickets
* financial assets like a share in a company
* a fiat currency like USD
* an ounce of gold
* and more...
